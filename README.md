# Route 41
This is a Scrap Mechanic custom game forked from [Drive](https://github.com/FoilFields/Drive).

## Description
There is a very long road ahead of you. You must use your creativity and willpower to make it through, good luck!

I did not like many of the changes made in the original custom game so this fork aims to make the experience more similar to the base game, and less similar to the Long Drive.

## Changes:
 - Readded Hunger, Thirst (they deplete slowly since there aren't any renewable sources)
 - Allowed bed respawns
 - Removed lift

## More to come:
 - Removed most blocks from builds to enforce creative building with the available parts
 - A couple more points of interest
 - Added a dressing bot and cloth boxes
 - Added bots
 - End goal


A huge thank you to FoilFields for the base custom game!
